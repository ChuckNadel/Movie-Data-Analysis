# An Analysis of Movie Data from 2010-2019


### The Business Scenario
Microsoft has made the decision to wield their creative intellictual property, and make their foray into the movie industry. The problem is, they don't know anything about making movies. So, they've hired us to analyze recent movies, in order to help them make the decision of what kind of movies they should make.

In this analysis, my main goals were to determine which genre generated the most consistently positive results from a profitability standpoint, and find the directors who made these outcomes happen for those genres.

### The Data
The Data we used was from IMDB and The Numbers. IMDB provided us with data from all movies from 2010-2019. The main information we used were the Movie Names, Audience Ratings, Director's Names, and Genre. The Numbers Database provided us with financial data about these movies, including the production budgets, domestic box office, and international box office.


### What We Found
The first thing we analyzed were which movie genres generated the most consistent profits. As shown on the graph below, we found that Animation Movies were profitable 73% of the time and only lost money at an 8% rate. Adventure and Science Fiction movies also generated profits at around 64% of the time. From these observations, we concluded that Microsoft should mainly focus on animated films.

The second thing we looked at was the correlation between the number of IMDB ratings a movie recieved, and their profit. As shown in the graph below, they are have a relatively strong positive correlation, meaning that Microsoft should focus on generating buzz around their films, so that people talk about them, and then go out to see them. We also found a list of directors who were particularly great at generating lots of IMDB ratings, with the best one being Christopher Nolan, whose movies are always a great topic for conversation.

Another thing we looked at the effect of production budget on worldwide profit. As shown on the graph below, their is a strong positive correlation between the budget of a film, and the profit it generates. Therefore, we would suggest that if Microsoft decides to make movies, they should shoot to allocate at least 100 million dollars per film.

Lastly, we took what we knew from the graph above, and decided to look at which directors generated the highest profits with limited budget. The graph below is very similar to the last one, but we grouped the data by who directed the film, such that each point represents one director. The ones highlighted in blue are Pierre Coffin, Chris Renaud, and Kyle Balda, all of whom have succeeded in creating highly profitable movies with smaller budgets. Lucky for us, all three of them are well renowned directors of animated films. Therefore, we would suggest Microsoft pick one of three in order to create their animated films.

### Conclusion

In this analysis, we explored movie data from 2010-2019 in order to 'recommend' to Microsoft what kind of movies they should make. The main takeaways we had were that Microsoft should create Animated films, as they generate profits the most consistently by far, and should hire Pierre Coffin, Chris Renaud, or Kyle Balda to direct. In addition, Microsoft should focus on generating buzz online, so that more people go out and see the film.

##### In essence, if I were Microsoft, I would create a Minecraft animated film, as that is part of the intellectual property, and the data shows that it has a high probability of being successful.
